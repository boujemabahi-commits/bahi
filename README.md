# JadPro (formerly TASYIIR)

TASYIIR (created by IAM Agency) is a multi-tenant SaaS for tutoring / language / coaching centers, in Arabic (RTL). It is a real Laravel 12 + Livewire 3 + Tailwind application with authentication, single-database multi-tenancy, per-center staff accounts with roles & permissions (owner / reception / accountant + custom roles), a reviewed public signup flow (`/register-center` → platform-admin approval at `/admin` → the center goes live), and every module — Students, Teachers, Courses, Groups, Enrollments, Attendance, Schedule, Payments (with printable receipts), Expenses, Salaries, Notifications, Dashboard, Reports, Statistics and Settings — running on the database. The migration from the Phase 1 mockup is complete; the mock data layer has been removed.

See **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)** for installation, seeded logins (one owner, one receptionist and one accountant per tenant), the module-by-module state and what would be new product surface beyond the original brief.

## Stack

- Laravel 12, Livewire 3 (+ Volt for the login page), Laravel Breeze (Livewire stack)
- Spatie `laravel-permission` for roles
- Tailwind CSS 3 via Vite; Alpine.js (bundled by Livewire) for small UI-only interactions; Chart.js vendored
- SQLite by default; MySQL/Postgres via `.env`

## History

`NOTES.md` keeps the phase-by-phase status banners plus the Phase 1 write-up explaining why the first pass was a dependency-free mockup and how it was designed to be lifted into real Laravel.
